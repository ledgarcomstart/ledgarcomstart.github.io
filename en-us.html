    <h2>Welcome to Ledger.com/start</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the official <strong>Ledger.com/start</strong> setup page. Here, you’ll find everything you need to get started with your
      <strong>Ledger hardware wallet</strong>—including installation of <strong>Ledger Live</strong>, device initialization,
      firmware updates, and best practices for securing your crypto assets.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Ledger?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ledger</strong> is a world leader in cryptocurrency security. With millions of users worldwide,
      Ledger’s hardware wallets—like the <em>Ledger Nano S Plus</em>, <em>Ledger Nano X</em>, and <em>Ledger Stax</em>—keep your
      private keys safe offline. Combined with the <strong>Ledger Live</strong> app, you can easily buy, sell, swap, stake, and
      manage over 5,500 coins and tokens while maintaining full control of your assets.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Start at Ledger.com/start?</h2>
    <p>
      Visiting <strong>Ledger.com/start</strong> ensures you’re following the official and most secure setup process.
      Unfortunately, there are fake websites and phishing pages designed to steal recovery phrases.
      Always confirm that you are on the <strong>official Ledger website</strong> before entering any information.
    </p>

    <h3>Here’s what you can do at Ledger.com/start:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Download and install the official <strong>Ledger Live app</strong>.</li>
      <li>Set up and initialize your Ledger hardware wallet.</li>
      <li>Update your device firmware safely.</li>
      <li>Learn how to protect your recovery phrase.</li>
      <li>Access support and educational resources from Ledger.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
      <a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live" class="button">Download Ledger Live</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Download Ledger Live</h2>
    <p>
      The first step in setting up your Ledger device is to download the <strong>Ledger Live</strong> application.
      This is the official companion app used to manage your hardware wallet. Ledger Live is available for
      <strong>Windows, macOS, Linux</strong>, as well as <strong>iOS and Android</strong> mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Download only from the <a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live" target="_blank">official Ledger Live page</a>.
      Avoid third-party websites or links shared in social media posts or forums.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Set Up Your Ledger Device</h2>
    <p>
      Once Ledger Live is installed, connect your Ledger device via USB (or Bluetooth for the Nano X).
      Follow the on-screen instructions carefully. You’ll be prompted to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose to create a new wallet or restore an existing one.</li>
      <li>Set up a secure <strong>PIN code</strong> for device access.</li>
      <li>Write down your <strong>24-word recovery phrase</strong> on the provided recovery sheet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Important:</h3>
    <p>
      Your <strong>recovery phrase</strong> is the only way to restore your wallet if your Ledger is lost or damaged.
      Never share it with anyone. Ledger will never ask for your recovery phrase—no matter the reason.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Verify and Secure Your Device</h2>
    <p>
      After setup, Ledger Live will verify the authenticity of your hardware wallet. This step ensures
      that your device has not been tampered with or compromised before shipping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once verified, you can install the apps for your preferred cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana)
      directly from Ledger Live.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4: Add Accounts to Ledger Live</h2>
    <p>
      To start managing your crypto, add accounts for each asset you hold. In Ledger Live:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the <strong>“Accounts”</strong> tab.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>“Add Account”</strong> and select your desired cryptocurrency.</li>
      <li>Follow the prompts to synchronize your wallet with your Ledger device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your balances will then appear on your Ledger Live dashboard, along with real-time price updates.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 5: Buy, Send, Receive, and Stake Crypto</h2>
    <p>
      With Ledger Live and your device properly set up, you can now:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buy crypto</strong> directly through trusted partners integrated in Ledger Live.</li>
      <li><strong>Send and receive</strong> assets securely—each transaction must be confirmed on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Swap coins</strong> without transferring funds to exchanges.</li>
      <li><strong>Stake cryptocurrencies</strong> like Ethereum, Solana, or Polkadot to earn rewards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security Tips from Ledger</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always store your <strong>24-word recovery phrase</strong> offline and in a safe place.</li>
      <li>Never enter your recovery phrase on a computer or smartphone.</li>
      <li>Regularly update Ledger Live and your device firmware for the latest security improvements.</li>
      <li>Beware of phishing websites—always check that the address bar shows <strong>https://www.ledger.com</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Need Help?</h2>
    <p>
      If you encounter any issues during setup or use, visit the
      <a href="https://support.ledger.com" target="_blank">official Ledger Support Center</a> for troubleshooting,
      tutorials, and FAQs. You can also access the Ledger Academy for educational resources about crypto security,
      staking, DeFi, and NFTs.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Choose Ledger for Crypto Security?</h2>
    <p>
      Ledger wallets use a certified secure element chip—the same kind used in passports and credit cards—to keep
      your private keys isolated from online threats. This hardware-level protection ensures that even if your
      computer or smartphone is compromised, your crypto remains safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combined with the transparent, open-source nature of Ledger’s software and firmware verification tools,
      users can fully trust that their devices are genuine and uncompromise.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Getting started at <strong>Ledger.com/start</strong> is the safest and most reliable way to set up your Ledger
      wallet and begin managing your digital assets. Follow the instructions carefully, always secure your
      recovery phrase, and only download software from Ledger’s official website.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Ledger Live and your hardware wallet, you’re not just managing crypto—you’re taking control of your
      financial future in the most secure way possible.
